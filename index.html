            <h3>Jude Bellingham</h3>
            <p class="col">
                12 games:
                11 goals
                3 assists
            </p>
            <p>Once again, 20-year-old Bellingham proved to be the difference for Real Madrid. The former Birmingham City midfielder, who joined Los Blancos from Borussia Dortmund this summer, was integral to the Spanish La Liga side's attacks. He almost scored just after the restart, controlling a cross with his chest and seeing his volley on the turn tipped over the bar by Braga keeper Matheus. His strike, which was placed into the far bottom corner from the edge of the box, is his third in three Champions League matches this season. He also has 11 goals in 12 league matches this season and one for England as he maintains his excellent start to life in Madrid.</p>
